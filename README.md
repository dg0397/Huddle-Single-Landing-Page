# Huddle-Single-Landing-Page
Huddle landing page with single introductory section(Frontend Mentor Challenge):

I used webpack to compile all code ( sass, html, js); 

If you want to run the code on your computer: 
1. Download the repository or clone it 

2. open a terminal in the project folder and type 
- npm install; 
- npm run start;
